The code is implemented on jupyter notebook so .ipynb files are added

new_lstm.ipynb : this is the main code file for lstm implementation on  modified KDD-CUP dataset

KDD_modified.csv:This is the dataset used for the code with modifications like 500 instances of each attack

CICIDS folder:This includes implementation for the CICIDS 2017 datset with abstraction for 20 instances for one dataset and storing each one of them in a separate .txt file.
